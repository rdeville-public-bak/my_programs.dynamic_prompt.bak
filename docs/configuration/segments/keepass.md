# `keepass` Segment

## Description

This segment show the value of variable `KEEPASS_NAME` when this one is set to
inform me when I have some keepass variables loaded to access my keepass
database from CLI.

I have my own wrapper around keepassxc-cli to use these keepass variables which
is stored in `tools/keepass`. If you want to use it, you are free to do so. You
can put in your a folder in your `PATH`to be able to use it anywhere.

Variables used by the script `tools/keepass` are automatically set using
[direnv][direnv].

To see how to use `direnv` for your folder, see
[Using direnv to setup environment-variables][using_direnv]

This segment is only shown when global shell environment variable `KEEPASS_NAME`
exists and is not empty.

## Requirements

This segment has no requirement as it only show value of variable
`KEEPASS_NAME`.

But if you wish to use it with the script provided, you may require
[keepassxc][keepassxc] to have the command `keepassxc-cli`.
