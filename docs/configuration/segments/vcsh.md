# `vcsh` Segemnt

## Description

As I use [vcsh][vcsh] to manage my dotfiles, I need to know when I am in a vcsh
shell.

This segment is only shown when in a vcsh shell, i.e. when global variable
`VCSH_REPO_NAME` exists and is not empty. The content of the segment is the
value of variable `VCSH_REPO_NAME`.

## Requirements

Obviously, this segement requires `vcsh` to be installed.
