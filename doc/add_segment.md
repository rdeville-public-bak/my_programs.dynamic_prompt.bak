# Description

This document is a little tutorial in which we will add a segment showing the
date. It is a simple one, but can be make dynamic, with colors, etc.

This segment will **never be added** to the main tree, as its aims to be the support
of this tutorial, moreover, I do not need it, but feel free to keep it
versionned on your own branch/fork ;-) (and ensure that it will be untracked
when proposing a merge request)

This tutorial assumes that you have made a fork of the main repo, i.e. you
already read and apply [Keep your configuration][keep_your_configuration].
